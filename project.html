    <p>Innovating agricultural automation with robotics and IoT</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Coconut harvesting is a labour-intensive and hazardous task, often requiring skilled
climbers to scale tall trees. To address this challenge, this project focuses on the design
and implementation of an unmanned remote-controlled coconut tree climbing and
harvesting robot. The proposed system consists of a mechanized climbing mechanism,
a cutting tool, and a wireless control interface, enabling safe and eÔ¨Écient harvesting.
The robot employs a motorized gripping and climbing system that adapts to varying
trunk diameters and surface irregularities. A remote-controlled cutting arm is
integrated to ensure precise harvesting without damaging the tree. The system is
designed with lightweight yet durable materials to enhance mobility and eÔ¨Éciency.
Field tests were conducted to evaluate the robot‚Äôs climbing stability, cutting eÔ¨Éciency,
battery performance, and operational feasibility. Results indicate that the robot
successfully ascends coconut trees, performs controlled cutting, and descends safely,
reducing human eÔ¨Äort and risk. Performance comparisons with traditional methods
highlight improvements in safety, speed, and reliability. This innovation presents a
promising solution for automated coconut harvesting, reducing dependence on manual
labour while ensuring sustainability and productivity in the agricultural sector.
